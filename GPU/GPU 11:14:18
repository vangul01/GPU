GPU 11/14/18

Threads, Blocks and Kernels

Number of blocks is equal to number of SMs 
all kernels use at least as many blocks as there are streaming multiprocessors in the GPU

You can get bandwidth with 384-bit 7 GHz GDDR6
by 384 * 7 * 2 (2 is for the double in DD)

skim chapters 7/8 because its not gonna be on the test


Convolution
....

trick, launch a redundant kernel before any other kernel launch because apparently it improves time... idk
