shared memory means copied per block
1000 blocks with 512 threads, local variable in kernel
	1000 times executed in shared memory
	152,000 times executed in global memory

Number of threads matters! Not number of blocks...

No pluses of less threads and more kernels
Minuses are if you have more work per thread, that means you have less resources per block, perhaps less parallelization
more threads less work means more parallelism but if you want to synchronize between threads

Dynamic shared memory if you dont know size beforehand
